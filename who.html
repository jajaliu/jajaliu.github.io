                        <h3>I've worked in a client service role for almost 4 years as an account/project manager within the social media agency industry. A couple years ago, I was looking to study part-time
                            to broaden my skill set, which led me to start a Graduate Diploma in Computing at University of Sydney. Since then, I've fallen in love with 
                            coding and discovered the addictiveness of it.</h3>

                        <h3>To further build my coding skills, I applied for the SheCodes PLUS program, which takes a more practical approach and 
                            would teach me web dev languages.</h3>
